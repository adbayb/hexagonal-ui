## 🏗️ Architecture

Two main layers:

-   **Core**: like the Application core in the hexagonal architecture, it centralizes all the core library logic and includes two levels
    -   Elements: Low-level entities modelizing HTML elements
    -   Patterns: Element aggregates implementing UX patterns (documented in the [WCAG website](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/))
-   **Adapters**: Surrounding the core, this layer aims to interact with it to implement framework specificities. There'll be typically one adapter library per UI framework. Each library is a concrete implementation of the different ports/interfaces exposed by the core (eg. ViewModel ports, ...)
